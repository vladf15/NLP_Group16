True,A girl named Laura Buxton released a balloon that ended up in the hands of another girl named Laura Buxton who lived 140 miles away.,"weather balloons are a type of high altitude balloon specifically used for transporting scientific payloads into our upper atmosphere. they can carry their payloads as high as 40,000 m ~ 130,000 ft. every day approximately 800 meteorological weather balloons are released at 00:00 and again at 12:00 gmt at locations around the world. this provides a snapshot of our earths upper atmosphere twice a day. the few launches done by amateurs every day are just a drop in the bucket compared to the 1,600 or so launches done by meteorological organizations around the world. different sizes - weather balloons are listed by weight in grams and not by physical size. a 350 g weather balloon weighs 350 g, a 1200 g weather balloon weighs 1200 g etc. weather balloons typically all share the same thickness latex skin, regardless of their ""size"". the difference in weight between different size balloons comes from the size of the mold the balloon was manufactured on. a larger mold required more latex and therefore the final cured balloon will weigh more. it also means the balloon will stretch to a larger diameter before bursting. in the image to the left, joseph is holding our 1500 g weather balloon. it was cured on a mold almost 2 meters in diameter. if you have never launched a weather balloon before, we recommend starting with a 350 or 600 g weather balloon. they are a lot more forgiving to work with on the ground and are still capable of taking our eagle pro kit to an altitude of 90,000 ft or more. larger weather balloons such as our 1200 or 1500 g balloons are much more challenging to work with on the ground because they have a much larger uninflated diameter. a larger balloon also requires a lot more helium just to compensate for its own weight which will significantly increase the cost of your launch. how weather balloons work - a weather balloon filled with helium will fly for the same reason oil floats on water. oil has less density than water. as an experiment, pour a tablespoon of cooking oil into a glass of water. you should see the oil rise to the surface of the water. just as the oil has less density than water and rises to the surface of the water, helium has less density than air and will rise to the surface of the earth's atmosphere. this is a good thing for us because the surface of our atmosphere is where space begins and where we want to fly our payload. by trapping the helium inside a balloon, we can attach a line to the balloon, called the flight train, with our payload suspended at the other end. the balloon will then lift our payload to the edge of space. however, as the balloon climbs higher, the pressure in the atmosphere decreases. the reduced pressure causes the balloon to expand. weather balloons are specially designed to be able to expand to a very large diameter. joseph is demonstrating this with a leaf blower we hooked up to the same balloon he was holding in the previous image. a weather balloon that starts out at 2 m in diameter at launch can expand to a diameter of up to 10 m. as the balloon climbs to the edge of space it eventually expands to the point where it bursts. our payload then falls back to earth under a parachute. as long as we can track our payload, we can recover it along with its recorded scientific data and flight video. when girls marry early, they and their families are more likely to live in poverty. 36% of girls in liberia are married before the age of 18, according to the young girl who cycled 1200 kilometres to take her ... helped lift out of homelessness in the period of 2013-16 were simply given one-way tickets out of the city. huey, laura. &quot;homelessness and the exclusive societythesis: in june 2001, laura buxton (almost 10) released a red balloon into the air over her hometown of stoke-on-trent in staffordshire, england. on one side of the balloon, she had written please return to laura buxton, and on the other side, her home address. a few weeks later, a man 140 miles away in milton lilbourne found the balloon stuck in the hedge that separated his farm from the next-door neighbors. he noticed laura buxtons name and address and immediately took the balloon to the neighbors house, showing it to the 10-year-old girl who lived therewhose name was also laura buxton. laura buxton from milton lilbourne wrote laura buxton from stoke-on-trent to let her know that shed found the balloon. thinking this coincidence was simply too amazing to be true, they decided they had to meet in person. and thats when things got really weird."

""excess deaths so obviously increased dramatically during the covid-19 pandemic that were able to, with some level of confidence, say that covid was causing those excess deaths, said spencer fox, an assistant professor in epidemiology and biostatistics at the university of georgia. oecd and the expos did not respond to requests for comment. 20 mars 2020  italy's previous one-day record death toll was 475 on wednesday. italy has seen more than 1,500 fatalities from covid-19 in the past three days ... nov 30, 2022  the share of covid-19 deaths among those who are vaccinated has risen. in fall 2021, about 3 in 10 adults dying of covid-19 were vaccinated or ..."

False,“60% of patients admitted to the hospital in the UK have been fully vaccinated”,"in this analysis, we seek to quantify the number of hospitalizations that could have been prevented by vaccination and the total cost of these hospitalizations. we find there were a total of 690,000 vaccine-preventable covid-19 hospitalizations from june through november 2021. these hospitalizations correspond with the delta variant surge. (there is still uncertainty around the vaccines effectiveness at preventing hospitalizations resulting from the omicron variant taking hold in december, though early indications suggest vaccination will be protective against severe disease.) we used cdc data on hospitalizations reported among people with covid-19 vaccines for breakthrough hospitalizations to estimate the share of hospitalizations with a covid-19 diagnosis that were among unvaccinated adults. from june 1-august 30, 2021, cdc reported 7,617 patients with covid-19 breakthrough infections were hospitalized and about 25% of those breakthrough hospitalizations were asymptomatic or admitted for a reason unrelated to covid-19. based on approximately 530,000 hospital admissions with confirmed covid-19 diagnosis in june-august 2021, we estimate 98.6% of hospital admissions with covid-19 during this period were among unvaccinated people (1  7,617/530,000 equals 98.6%). reports of covid-related hospitalizations among unvaccinated people range from 95% to 99.9% by state. we used the estimate from our analysis with epic research that found unvaccinated people accounted for 85% of covid-19 hospitalizations from june-september 2021. additionally, our assumption on the share of covid-19 hospitalizations among unvaccinated adults that were covid-related is based on our analysis with epic research, which found 82% of unvaccinated patients hospitalized with covid-19 had covid-related complications or treatment. our third step is to adjust for the fact that  even if these unvaccinated adults had gotten the vaccine, the vaccine would not prevent 100% of hospitalizations. based on cdc data for the effectiveness of the covid-19 vaccines in preventing hospitalizations at 13-24 weeks, we assume that 84% of hospitalizations primarily for covid-19 are preventable with vaccinations. multiplying the number of adults hospitalized primarily due to covid-19 by the percent of hospitalizations preventable by vaccination (84%) gives us the number of preventable hospitalizations. this is again a conservative assumption, as other studies have pointed to a higher level of protection from hospitalization. chart information hospitalization counts include all patients diagnosed with covid-19 during their stay. this does not necessarily mean they were hospitalized because of covid-19 complications or that they experienced covid-19 symptoms. hospitalized patients include all patients diagnosed with covid-19 during their stay. this does not necessarily mean they were hospitalized because of covid-19 complications or that they experienced covid-19 symptoms. suspected covid-19 patient data is available in the hospitalized patients and icu source data. 2021, among individuals not reported as fully vaccinated, and 6,801 hospitalizations and 1,534 deaths among fully vaccinated individuals in the same time hospitalized vaccinated persons were older the study results suggest that persons with underlying conditions are more likely to be vaccinated u.s. hospital statistics: number of hospitals, staffed hospital beds, and admissions. total number of all u.s. hospitals. 6,129. number of u.s. community ..."

False,Says the surge in COVID-19 cases is caused by “antibody mediated viral enhancement” from the COVID-19 vaccines.,"neither covid-19 disease nor the new covid-19 vaccines have shown evidence of causing ade. vaccine constructs that failed to protect against number of tests compare to the number of confirmed covid-19 cases? israel: the case fatality rate. related chart: covid 19 total confirmed cases vs total currently, less than 35% of pregnant women are fully vaccinated for covid-19. this is concerning because the cdc issued an urgent warning for pregnant women to get vaccinated, as studies show that being pregnant doubles the risk of death from covid-19. no. higher rates of miscarriage are not found in women who are vaccinated for covid-19. no evidence supports that covid-19 vaccines increase the risk of having a miscarriage or causing infertility. miscarriage is a difficult time for families, but getting vaccinated for covid-19 does not increase the likelihood of having a miscarriage. unfortunately, women who develop severe covid-19 infection early in pregnancy are at increased risk of miscarriage. will there be another covid-19 surge? in january 2021, after the fda had authorized covid-19 vaccines for emergency use the month before, people in the u.s. began to be vaccinated. by march, the daily number of new infections had steeply declined, and april through june saw those numbers go down even further. but by july, arrival and spread of the delta coronavirus variant sparked another surge in cases of covid-19. as of october 2021, infection rates appear to be declining, probably in part due to more people getting vaccinated. more ups and downs in infection rates could be in our future until the pandemic recedes. doctors, clinics and hospitals recognize that more covid-19 surges are possible. they are working with manufacturers to stock up on equipment, and they are continuing their policies for protecting patients and staff members. heres what you can do now: get vaccinated for covid-19. learn more about the safety and effectiveness of the covid-19 vaccines. is the delta variant causing more covid cases? yes. since the beginning of the covid-19 pandemic, sars-cov-2  the coronavirus that causes covid-19  has mutated (changed), resulting in variants of the virus. one of these is called the delta variant. the delta coronavirus is considered one of the most contagious variants so far. learn more about coronavirus variants. although vaccines afford very high protection, breakthrough coronavirus infection with the delta and other variants remains possible. fortunately, vaccination, even among those who acquire infections, is very effective at preventing serious illness, hospitalization and death from covid-19. check the cdcs covid-19 transmission map, and stay in touch with local health authorities, who can provide information if covid-19 cases begin to increase in your city or town. when whole antibodies elicited in viral infection at a suboptimal concentration that is generally expected to be protective, provide an advantage to the virus by giving entry access to the cells that could lead to the enhancement of the infection called antibody-dependent enhancement (ade), then the risk of aggravating the severity of infection increases. sars-cov-2 infection leads to the production of neutralizing antibodies, but the extent to which these antibodies would be neutralizing and protective to the subsequent sars-cov-2 infection is still not clear. some reports of sars-cov-2 reinfection have been published, elucidating illness with the genetically distinct strain of sars-cov-2 with symptomatic reinfection24,25,26. there is a possibility of severe cases of infection during a secondary infection with sars-cov-2, similar to denv serotypes as reported previously, due to the risk of cross-reactive antibodies potentially capable of promoting ade. this cross-reactivity of antibodies with different strains may give rise to the phenomenon of ade and make the symptoms more severe; acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) is majorly attributed to the severe cases of illness that have emerged to be the leading cause of death in covid-19, similar to sars and mers6. even though the link between ade of infection and disease severity is yet to be established, in the past, the severity of infection and cross-reactivity of antibodies to other viral serotypes have been linked and established in vitro for zika, dengue, and influenza a viral infection28,29,30. these previous and current studies point towards the requirement of proactive research in the immunopathology caused by covid-19. because a large and variable group of people are getting infected with severity ranging from mild to severe cases of illness, therefore, the possibility of ade is worth considering."

therefore, a single death might be included in more than one category when describing the number of drug overdose deaths involving specific drugs. for example, a death that involved both heroin and fentanyl would be included in both the number of drug overdose deaths involving heroin and the number of drug overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids other than methadone. the percentage of death records in which a specific drug or drug class is identified as involved in a drug overdose death varies by jurisdiction (7). selected jurisdictions consistently had 90% or more of drug overdose death certificates mentioning at least one specific drug for all of the 12-month ending periods included in the dashboard. provisional counts of drug overdose deaths where a specific drug or drug class is reported on the death certificate are presented for the united states and for jurisdictions meeting this threshold. additionally, as a data quality metric, the percentage of drug overdose death records where at least one drug or drug class is recorded is presented. the united states is experiencing an epidemic of drug overdose (poisoning) deaths. since 2000, the rate of deaths from drug overdoses has increased 137%, including a 200% increase in the rate of overdose deaths involving opioids (opioid pain relievers and heroin). cdc analyzed recent multiple cause-of-death mortality data to examine current trends and characteristics of drug overdose deaths, including the types of opioids associated with drug overdose deaths. during 2014, a total of 47,055 drug overdose deaths occurred in the united states, representing a 1-year increase of 6.5%, from 13.8 per 100,000 persons in 2013 to 14.7 per 100,000 persons in 2014. the rate of drug overdose deaths increased significantly for both sexes, persons aged 2544 years and 55 years, non-hispanic whites and non-hispanic blacks, and in the northeastern, midwestern, and southern regions of the united states. rates of opioid overdose deaths also increased significantly, from 7.9 per 100,000 in 2013 to 9.0 per 100,000 in 2014, a 14% increase. historically, cdc has programmatically characterized all opioid pain reliever deaths (natural and semisynthetic opioids, methadone, and other synthetic opioids) as ""prescription"" opioid overdoses (1). between 2013 and 2014, the age-adjusted rate of death involving methadone remained unchanged; however, the age-adjusted rate of death involving natural and semisynthetic opioid pain relievers, heroin, and synthetic opioids, other than methadone (e.g., fentanyl) increased 9%, 26%, and 80%, respectively. the sharp increase in deaths involving synthetic opioids, other than methadone, in 2014 coincided with law enforcement reports of increased availability of illicitly manufactured fentanyl, a synthetic opioid; however, illicitly manufactured fentanyl cannot be distinguished from prescription fentanyl in death certificate data. these findings indicate that the opioid overdose epidemic is worsening. there is a need for continued action to prevent opioid abuse, dependence, and death, improve treatment capacity for opioid use disorders, and reduce the supply of illicit opioids, particularly heroin and illicit fentanyl. in 2014, 61% (28,647, data not shown) of drug overdose deaths involved some type of opioid, including heroin. the age-adjusted rate of drug overdose deaths involving opioids increased significantly from 2000 to 2014, increasing 14% from 2013 (7.9 per 100,000) to 2014 (9.0) (figure 1). from 2013 to 2014, the largest increase in the rate of drug overdose deaths involved synthetic opioids, other than methadone (e.g., fentanyl and tramadol), which nearly doubled from 1.0 per 100,000 to 1.8 per 100,000 (figure 2). heroin overdose death rates increased by 26% from 2013 to 2014 and have more than tripled since 2010, from 1.0 per 100,000 in 2010 to 3.4 per 100,000 in 2014 (figure 2). in 2014, the rate of drug overdose deaths involving natural and semisynthetic opioids (e.g., morphine, oxycodone, and hydrocodone), 3.8 per 100,000, was the highest among opioid overdose deaths, and increased 9% from 3.5 per 100,000 in 2013. the rate of drug overdose deaths involving methadone, a synthetic opioid classified separately from other synthetic opioids, was similar in 2013 and 2014. during 2014, 47,055 drug overdose deaths occurred in the united states. since 2000, the age-adjusted drug overdose death rate has more than doubled, from 6.2 per 100,000 persons in 2000 to 14.7 per 100,000 in 2014 (figure 1). the overall number and rate of drug overdose deaths increased significantly from 2013 to 2014, with an additional 3,073 deaths occurring in 2014 (table), resulting in a 6.5% increase in the age-adjusted rate. from 2013 to 2014, statistically significant increases in drug overdose death rates were seen for both males and females, persons aged 2534 years, 3544 years, 5564 years, and 65 years; non-hispanic whites and non-hispanic blacks; and residents in the northeast, midwest and south census regions (table). in 2014, the five states with the highest rates of drug overdose deaths were west virginia (35.5 deaths per 100,000), new mexico (27.3), new hampshire (26.2), kentucky (24.7) and ohio (24.6). states with statistically significant increases in the rate of drug overdose deaths from 2013 to 2014 included alabama, georgia, illinois, indiana, maine, maryland, massachusetts, michigan, new hampshire, new mexico, north dakota, ohio, pennsylvania, and virginia. furthermore, people who were formerly incarcerated are at an increased risk ... more likely to die of an opioid overdose than someone in the general population. by pj joudrey  2019  cited by 128  post-release opioid-related overdose mortality is the leading cause of death among people released from jails or prisons (prjp)."

(see figure 2.) claims by repeal proponents that the estate tax consumes nearly half of an estates value are therefore false. the estate tax also serves as a modest corrective to other tax rules that provide massive tax benefits to income from wealth, such as the fact that capital gains are taxed at lower rates than wages and salaries. the top 0.1 percent of taxpayers  those with incomes above $3.1 million  will receive 56 percent of the benefit of the preferential capital gains rates in 2017, worth more than $600,000 apiece.[15] other tax rules allow part of the income of the very wealthiest to go completely untaxed, even with the estate tax.[16] the effective rate is so much lower than the top rate for several reasons. first, estate taxes are due only on the portion of an estates value that exceeds the exemption level; at the 2017 exemption level of $5.49 million, a $6 million estate would owe estate taxes on $510,000 at most. second, heirs can often shield a large portion of an estates remaining value from taxation through generous deductions and other discounts that policymakers have enacted over time.[7] further, as explained below, estates use large loopholes to avoid considerable amounts of tax. the bill also proposes to double the withholding tax rate applicable to the dividends payable by a sacco from five to 10 per cent. sacco members should ... as the accompanying table illustrates, for an asset worth $100 million (all of which is a capital gain for the sake of simplicity), the two changes would mean an immediate capital gains tax liability of $42.9 million at the time of death. upon paying the capital gains tax at death, the value of the $100 million asset falls to $57 million for the purposes of the estate tax. after subtracting the $11.7 million exemption, the 40 percent estate tax rate is levied on the remaining $45.3 million in assets to produce an estate tax bill of about $18.1 million. in addition to bidens proposed tax hikes, large estates would also be subject to the current estate tax an estate tax is imposed on the net value of an individuals taxable estate, after any exclusions or credits, at the time of death. the tax is paid by the estate itself before assets are distributed to heirs. of 40 percent above an exemption of $11.7 million per person. combining both taxes results in a total tax liability of $61.1 million on the original $100 million asset, for an effective tax rate of 61 percent. the tax rate under bidens proposal is nearly twice the effective tax rate that the same asset would face today under existing tax rules. the city of newarks 2023-2024 property tax rate is $0.9815 per $100 of assessed value. newark residents pay real estate taxes based on the assessed value of their homes, as determined by new castle countys assessment office. new castle county property assessments are based upon 1983 property values. when a certificate of occupancy is issued after a building is constructed or improved, an assessor visits the property to determine the new assessment rate. the property assessment determines the amount of your property tax bill, as well as your school districts tax bill."

True,"""There’s not one public study, and by public study I mean a study available to the public, that has looked at using the product Kaput to poison feral hogs.""","in addition to the length of time and quantity needed to effectively poison a wild hog, many other concerns exist with the use of kaput. though warfarin has been used in rat poisons since the early 1950s, the consequences of using this product in new ways, such as wild hog baits, has not been thoroughly examined. mississippi is home to many unique species of threatened or endangered animals. the black bear, probably the most widely known species on the list, regularly occurs in much of mississippi. with its acute sense of smell, a black bear could easily locate and begin consuming this poison. therefore, a new threat like kaput on the landscape could present a major roadblock to the recent population progress made by this species. both sodium nitrite and warfarin have endured controlled testing on wild hogs in hopes of acquiring federal and state approval. while there is currently no substance that can legally be used for the purpose of poisoning wild hogs in the united states, there have been major progressions toward approval earlier this year. in january, the environmental protection agency (epa) approved a warfarin-based pesticide for registration called kaput. but federal registration is only the first step in an entire process of approving a product for use outside a controlled facility. after federal registration, each state must decide if the product will be licensed for use within its borders. if approved, a state must then decide what restrictions will be placed upon its use. as with most regulations, the states can be more restrictive than federal law, but not less. currently, no states have approved the use of any poison for use on wild hogs. so what is the difference between sodium nitrite and warfarin? quite frankly, everything is different. since the early 2000s, wild hog pesticide research has been conducted and tested in australia. many toxicants were studied and considered as options to control wild hog populations, including sodium nitrite, compound 1080 (sodium flouroacetate), yellow (white) phosphorous, and warfarin. while there was limited success in australian testing, there were also many problems. some poisons were banned because of how they caused death in wild hogs, while others were ousted out of concern for non-target animals. in the united states, however, only two substances have been seriously considered to stem the spread of these invaders. poch said the 2015 study was followed by another in 2016 with a third study under way in 2017, each one based on feeding the kaput product to feral hogs. both of the first two studies, he said, decimated exposed hog populations in north texas study areas; he noted that the bait uses only one-fifth of the warfarin found in conventional rat and mouse baits. herring said theres no public study of kaput, the product that might soon be available in texas to attack feral hogs. petroleum has historically been the most-consumed energy source in terms of total annual u.s. energy consumption. we use petroleum products to propel vehicles, ... 12 sept. 2020  in the cross-sectional study by ioannidis et al., publicly reported data on covid-19 deaths from. 14 countries and 13 us states with at least ... may 2, 2023  this cross-sectional study examines contributions to decreases in racial and ethnic disparities in covid-19 mortality among us adults from ..."

False,The State of the Environment report says just 27 species have become extinct in Australia between 1790 and 2010.,"so far, we have only spoken about hybrids created by humans. lions and tiger never meet naturally in the wild, but other hybrids do occur naturally. in fact, there are hundreds of hybrids in the natural world. it is thought that one in four plant species, and one in ten animal species, hybridize [6]. hybridization can help parental species by transferring new genes, through introgression, and can even lead to the creation of new species [5]. for example, south american heliconius butterflies have gained part of their beautiful wing patterns through hybridization (figure 3) [7]. heliconius butterflies use their wing patterns to attract mates, as well as to avoid predators, who interpret the patterns as warning signals. [7]. ancient hybridization of sunflower species has also generated new species in north america. these hybrid-origin sunflowers can live in more extreme environments, where the soil is poor or toxic. hybridization combined traits of the two parent species, forming a new gene combination in the hybrid that enabled it to live in this new habitat [8]. hybridization:  breeding between two different species. although many of the natural hybrids we have spoken about are from modern species, there are also examples of ancient hybridizations that happened tens of thousands of years ago. these hybrids can be identified even when the parental species are extinct. this is because some of the parent species genes will still be present in a small percentage in the hybrid. by comparing gene mutations between closely related species, we can find potential hybrids by looking for genes that are very different, or mutations that have come from one of the ancient hybrids parent species. using this method, an ancient hybrid was found to be an ancestor to many species of clownfish (like nemo from finding nemo). just like the sunflower, the combination of adaptations in this ancient hybrid allowed the clownfish ancestor to live in a new habitat [9]. as a result, this ancient hybrid is an ancestor to many modern clownfish species. 14 set 2023  feral cats threaten the survival of over 100 native species in australia. they have caused the extinction of some ground-dwelling birds and ... di c sims  2017  citato da 7  we consider the case where a species provides a flow of economic benefits, is at risk of extinction, and is being considered for addition to the endangered ... 24 mai 2010   verified that all paid uncompensated care claims ... claimed uncompensated care costs only for services covered under the state medicaid plan. jun 4, 2003  background. between 1790 and 1860, american slavery expanded on a grand scale: federal census records show the 1790 slave population of ..."

(see figure 2.) claims by repeal proponents that the estate tax consumes nearly half of an estates value are therefore false. the estate tax also serves as a modest corrective to other tax rules that provide massive tax benefits to income from wealth, such as the fact that capital gains are taxed at lower rates than wages and salaries. the top 0.1 percent of taxpayers  those with incomes above $3.1 million  will receive 56 percent of the benefit of the preferential capital gains rates in 2017, worth more than $600,000 apiece.[15] other tax rules allow part of the income of the very wealthiest to go completely untaxed, even with the estate tax.[16] the effective rate is so much lower than the top rate for several reasons. first, estate taxes are due only on the portion of an estates value that exceeds the exemption level; at the 2017 exemption level of $5.49 million, a $6 million estate would owe estate taxes on $510,000 at most. second, heirs can often shield a large portion of an estates remaining value from taxation through generous deductions and other discounts that policymakers have enacted over time.[7] further, as explained below, estates use large loopholes to avoid considerable amounts of tax. dec 3, 2016  a morton county spokeswoman initially said people could face $1,000 fines for trying to bring supplies to the camp, only to be contradicted ..."

(see figure 1 below and tables in appendix.) while the commercial prices for covid-19 vaccines are not yet known, both pfizer and moderna have signaled likely ranges that are three to four times greater than the pre-purchased federal price for the bivalent booster. in a recent investor call, pfizer indicated that it expected a commercial price per dose for its vaccine to be between $110 and $130. moderna has also suggested the same range. this range is 4 to almost 5 times greater than the weighted average price per dose paid by the federal government for moderna and pfizer bivalent doses ($28.90). here, we illustrate the potential total cost of pfizer and moderna covid-19 vaccines, based on their publicly-announced expected prices, once they enter the u.s. commercial market. specifically, we compare the average price paid by the federal government for the covid-19 bivalent boosters to the estimated average commercial prices that have been suggested by manufacturers, and calculate an overall cost for purchasing vaccines for the adult population (ages 18 and older) across different scenarios of vaccine uptake (we only estimate costs for purchasing a single vaccine dose under different population uptake scenarios though it is possible that additional boosters will be needed on an annual or some other regular basis). while four covid-19 vaccines have been authorized or approved for use in the united states, we focus our analysis only on pfizer and moderna vaccines, which account for almost all doses administered in the u.s.

Conflicting,"Says Ronald Reagan ""was behind in the polls in 1980 going into the debate with Jimmy Carter and then turned around 10 days later and won 40 states.""","campaign button hyping the october presidential debate between reagan and carter, 1980. (public domain) with their prior experience in hosting the 1976 elections debates, the league of women voters agreed to sponsor the reagan-carter debates in 1980. in response to carters reluctance to engage in any of the debates until september 1980, reagan famously boasted that carter would not be able to win a debate against him, even if it were held in the rose garden before an audience of administration officials with the questions being asked by jody powell. in carters absence, illinois representative john b. anderson  a third-party candidate from the national unity party  opted to attend the debates against reagan. after further intervals of negotiation between the reagan campaign and the league of women voters, it was finally agreed upon that a presidential debate between reagan and carter would be held on october 28. the televised debate shattered the viewership records of the past decade, as it showcased all the major political talking points of the election. carters campaign made an effort throughout the campaign season to portray reagan as a dangerous right-wing radical, who would siphon out all funding from medicare and social security, and in so doing undermine the progressive political moves made by the democrats since both the johnson and roosevelt administrations. meanwhile, the increasing negative reception of the carter administration was highlighted by the reagan campaign, including the recent iran hostage crisis and the poor economy. in response to carter saying that his 12-year-old daughter was concerned about nuclear warfare in the october presidential debate, he was lampooned by several political cartoons and late-night television jokes. among reagans more notable moments from the debate were his closing remarks. he asked the viewing public if they truly felt better off on a national, economic, and political level under the carter administration; and if they were not, then there was another choice that they had. the debate was seen as a win for reagan, as his campaign went from being behind carters by eight points to being ahead by three. central to reagans sudden surge in support after the debate was his frequent use of storytelling and carefully-timed witticisms, both of which helped to cement his public image as an appealing, likable figure. on election day, the reagan-bush ticket won 489 electoral votes against carter-mondales 49, rendering the former the winners of the 1980 presidential election. in addition, the republicans won majority control over both chambers of congress, shifting the legislative branch into republican control for the first time since eisenhowers election in 1952. at the time of his victory, ronald reagan was the oldest person to be made president at the age of 69. this record was later broken by donald trump at the age of 70 in 2016, and once again by joe biden at the age of 77 in 2020. for the republicans, the most popular of the prospective candidates was ronald reagan. after narrowly losing the nomination in the previous 1976 election, reagan managed to defeat several of his fellow republican candidates, including senate minority leader howard baker and senator robert dole. the strongest rival to reagan in the primaries was george herbert walker bush, a u.s. navy veteran, former congressman from texas, and the former director of central intelligence. despite the intense popularity of both candidates in their respective circles, reagan managed to win the nomination over bush at the republican national convention, after which the former chose the latter to serve as his running mate for the election. in the election cycle, reagan enjoyed support largely among evangelical christians, new deal-era democrats who had allied with the republicans after the 1960s, and the increasing electoral centers of the sun belt and the american suburbs. reagan made several public promises with the underlying goal of restoring american confidence and optimism, which had been severely tested and challenged by the troubles of the 1960s and 1970s. increasing defense spending was a high priority for reagans platform, as the american public had lost confidence in the u.s. militarys capabilities since both the vietnam war and carters ill-fated rescue mission in iran. to address the economic instabilities of the era, reagan proposed a balanced budget, the implementation of a supply-side economic policy (lower taxes, less regulations, free trade), and the withdrawal of carters previous windfall tax. if these policies were to be enacted, reagan promised that they would mark the beginning of the end of inflation. a central tenet to reagans campaign was his belief that the federal government had grown too far beyond the implied parameters of the constitution. he had held these beliefs since his earliest foray into politics in the 1960s, but the nationwide crises and incidents of corruption through the ensuing decades increased public belief in reagans views on smaller government. years later, it became clear how the presidential election that took place on nov. 4, 1980exactly 35 years agochanged americas history, ushering in a new era of conservatism and placing ronald reagan at its forefront. but up until the vote actually happened, few saw it coming. the kgb chief also stated that during their meeting in moscow tunney said kennedy wanted to run for president in 1988, and that showing he still had political muscle after his failed 1980 presidential bid could only help his ambitions. ""kennedy does not discount that during the 1984 campaign, the democratic party may officially turn to him to lead the fight against the republicans and elect their candidate president,"" chebrikov wrote. ted kennedy, the u.s. senate's longtime ""liberal lion,"" apparently tried to take advantage of reagan's aggressive stance toward communist russia -- by seeking the russians' assistance. the federalist's sean davis writes that ""in the midst of the cold war, (kennedy) begged them to intervene in a u.s. presidential election in order to unseat president ronald reagan."" this article discusses the domestic policy of the ronald reagan administration from 1981 to 1989. reagan's policies stressed conservative economic values 8 dic 2017  did the 1981 reagan tax cut spur enough economic growth that it paid for itself? a. when ronald reagan arrived in washington in 1981, ..."

(image credit: istock) the epas newly released affordable clean energy (ace) rule replaces the clean power plan (cpp), which was intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector by 32 percent in 2030 compared to 2005 levels. the plan, which went into effect but was almost immediately put on hold by the courts, would have allowed states to meet those goals through a variety of means, including switching from burning coal to natural gas, which produces significantly less greenhouse gases, or increasing renewable energy sources. it would also have made it difficult to build new coal-fired power plants. by contrast, the new rule aims to reduce power plant carbon emissions without actually setting limits on them. instead, the rule calls for efficiency improvements at generating stations and directs states to take the initiative on how they choose to regulate power plant emissions. supporters applaud the rules flexibility, empowerment of states and legal defensibility. critics say the change will lead to higher emissions, damage the health of people and the environment and slow the transition to a clean-energy economy. stanford news service spoke with economist charles kolstad, legal scholar deborah sivas and energy and climate policy expert michael wara about the new rule and its potential impacts. is there anything surprising about the revised plan? sivas: i thought the trump administration might just suspend the clean power plan and delay doing anything else at all. but im sure lawyers for the administration have figured out that under the clean air act and court precedents, epa actually must take action to abate greenhouse gas emissions. so, rather than ignore the law entirely, the administration has promulgated a final, much weaker rule. kolstad: i am struck that epas previous approach  replace the cpp with the ace  has been scrapped, due to logical flaws in their arguments, i presume, in favor of a two-step approach. first, declare the cpp as having no effect on emissions as well as having other flaws and then repealing it. secondly, show that the ace is a cost-benefit improvement on the new status quo of no cpp  impressive. its a sleight of hand. wara: i think the most important aspects of this rule have to do with how the benefits of reduced air pollution are treated. the trump epa has  from the beginning  emphasized the uncertainty of benefits associated with reducing emissions of particulates and ozone. they continue this approach under the final ace rule. this is likely to have knock-on effects for future air pollution regulations, and will be a precedent that is hard to undo even if a future administration wants to count these benefits. that will make further reductions in ozone and particulate matter harder to achieve. what does this mean for coal power in the u.s.? what is the industrys prognosis? kolstad: the main problems with coal power in the u.s. are cheap natural gas and risks associated with investing in it. neither cpp nor the ace are critical to the industrys outlook. it is interesting to note that the dow jones index of coal stocks had dropped about 10 percent from when donald trump took over. the introduction of the ace caused the index to rise about 7 percent  a modest sign of the extent to which markets think the ace will help the u.s. coal industry. my sense is that the ace will have very little impact on the continuing decline of coal-fired electricity production over the coming decade. wara: the ace rule forthrightly acknowledges that coal power is struggling economically in the u.s. indeed, the rule points out that the obama clean power plan targets are set to be achieved ahead of time and without any regulation. unless there is a dramatic change in the price of natural gas, coal-fired electricity is likely to continue to decline in importance while natural gas and renewable energy will increase as sources of power. sivas: a flurry of lawsuits by states and conservation groups will probably start soon and continue well beyond the 2020 election. that likely means that for the next few years, todays rule will have little on-the-ground impact. given the legal uncertainty, there is a substantial question of how the power sector will respond in the short term to market risks. but if todays rule is upheld by the courts and if trump is reelected, the overall result of epas action could be some extension of the life of coal-fired plants. it all depends on how markets respond to the legal and political uncertainty. is focusing solely on improving the efficiency of facilities sufficient to tackle the problem? wara: no. but the trump administration has taken the position that efficiency improvements are all that the legal authority provided by the clean air act will allow. heat rate improvements at coal- and gas-fired power plants will only go so far. ultimately, we need to replace coal and gas-fired power plants with zero-carbon resources if we are to have any hope of avoiding dangerous climate change. sivas: increased efficiency is a good thing, of course, because it reduces the pollution generated for each unit of energy produced. it remains to be seen whether the power industry will conclude that it is cost-effective to retrofit existing coal or other natural gas plants for increased efficiency  as opposed to looking toward renewable energy or options that allow consumers to reduce or shift their electricity usage in response to financial incentives. the problem from a climate perspective is that epas focus on retrofitting existing coal plants entirely ignores that switching to cleaner energy sources and demand-response policies is, in fact, the best way to reduce emissions. energy efficiency improvement alone will never bend the greenhouse gas emissions curve the way we need to. if there are no caps on emissions, what incentives are there for states to control emissions? kolstad: none from the feds, except for generating efficiency improvements. but states have many other reasons for wanting to reduce carbon emissions. carbon emissions are clearly in the crosshairs. maybe not for this federal administration but quite possibly the next. financial markets consider carbon emissions a financial risk, and the populations of many states, such as california, oregon and washington, want to clean up their act. wara: under ace, states have to ensure that power plants within their borders meet efficiency requirements. these are essentially rate-based standards set at the power plant level. under the clean power plan, by contrast, states had to achieve a statewide standard. given the evolution of the power system due to low natural gas prices, neither rule would create strong incentives for states to control emissions. what was the basis of the analysis that undergirds the new rule? sivas: in the proposed rule, epa was able to reach a different result than the clean power plan through various sleights-of-hand. for instance, the epa has changed how it calculates the social cost of carbon. the rule also ignores the incidental public health benefits  beyond reduced greenhouse gas emissions  associated with reduced power plant pollution. in certain ways, the rule narrowly reinterprets epas authority under the clean air act. all of these changes, collectively, allowed epa to significantly weaken the rule as compared to the clean power plan and still claim it is in compliance with the clean air act. what do you make of epa estimates that the new rule, when fully implemented, will lead to a 10-million-ton reduction in carbon dioxide (co 2 ) emissions and will provide annual net benefits of $70 million to $100 million or more? kolstad: a reduction of 10 million tons is nice, but it is about a half a percent of current power sector emissions. the benefits are probably understated since the trump administration controversially cut the social cost of carbon by about an order of magnitude, compared to the obama administrations $40 per ton for damages from co 2 . sivas: the clean power plan projected emission reductions at full implementation of 870 million tons. so if that is an apples-to-apples comparison, it pretty much says it all. with respect to the monetary benefits, it all depends on how one calculates the social cost of carbon and whether non-ghg [greenhouse gas] emissions reductions are factored into the benefits calculation  things like reduced particulate emissions that have serious morbidity and mortality effects. playing with those benefits assumptions, as epa did here, pretty much renders the resulting numbers meaningless. is it true, as epa administrator andrew wheeler has said, that the new rule is more legally defensible than cpp was? wara: the clean power plan utilized a novel interpretation of the clean air act to allow for more stringent regulation of polluting sources. the ace sticks to the traditional interpretation of the new source performance standards section of the act. so it does have less legal risk in that sense. however, various aspects of the rules approach to quantification of benefits and costs will no doubt be challenged in court, perhaps successfully. both rules were radical, albeit in different ways. i think theres a decent chance of this regulation failing to pass muster before the courts. sivas: the courts will ultimately decide, i guess. wheelers statement turns largely on the trump administration and power industry argument that the clean power plan illegally considered best system for emission reduction under the clean air act to include such beyond the fenceline options as fuel switching and demand response. indeed, the only way that the current epa arrived at energy efficiency as the best system for emission reduction was by saying that any activity beyond retrofitting of the existing power plant itself could not be considered in setting standards and developing the rule. wheelers new interpretation of the law is definitely much narrower than the pre-2016 interpretation, but that doesnt necessarily mean it is more legally defensible. epas regulations implementing this provision of the clean air act have historically allowed for practices like emissions trading schemes to meet standards. it is hard to guess what the courts might do with all of these complex, interwoven pieces. charles kolstad is a senior fellow at the stanford woods institute for the environment, the stanford institute for economic policy research and the stanford precourt institute for energy, and a professor of economics in the stanford school of humanities and sciences. he is co-director of the stanford bits & watts initiative. deborah a. sivas is the luke w. cole professor of environmental law, director of the environmental and natural resources law and policy program and director of the environmental law clinic at stanford law school, and a senior fellow at the stanford woods institute for the environment. michael wara is a senior research scholar and director of the climate and energy policy program at the stanford woods institute for the environment. to read all stories about stanford science, subscribe to the biweekly stanford science digest. -30- key takeaways an analysis by a consulting group shows some electric cars are more expensive to ""fuel up"" with electricity than their gas equivalents. some electric car owners are now experiencing higher costs to power their vehicles than to fill up their gas-powered equivalentsif you calculate the costs a certain way. analysis by the anderson economic group (aeg), a public policy consulting firm based in lansing, michigan, showed that in the first half of 2023, for most classes of vehicles, it cost more to drive a mile on electricity than on gas, according to the report. actions to implement the clean air act have achieved dramatic reductions in air pollution, preventing hundreds of thousands of cases of serious health ..."

Conflicting,"Ronald Reagan won the 1980 presidential election in a landslide despite trailing Jimmy Carter in public opinion polls two weeks earlier, so polls cannot be trusted to predict election results.","campaign button hyping the october presidential debate between reagan and carter, 1980. (public domain) with their prior experience in hosting the 1976 elections debates, the league of women voters agreed to sponsor the reagan-carter debates in 1980. in response to carters reluctance to engage in any of the debates until september 1980, reagan famously boasted that carter would not be able to win a debate against him, even if it were held in the rose garden before an audience of administration officials with the questions being asked by jody powell. in carters absence, illinois representative john b. anderson  a third-party candidate from the national unity party  opted to attend the debates against reagan. after further intervals of negotiation between the reagan campaign and the league of women voters, it was finally agreed upon that a presidential debate between reagan and carter would be held on october 28. the televised debate shattered the viewership records of the past decade, as it showcased all the major political talking points of the election. carters campaign made an effort throughout the campaign season to portray reagan as a dangerous right-wing radical, who would siphon out all funding from medicare and social security, and in so doing undermine the progressive political moves made by the democrats since both the johnson and roosevelt administrations. meanwhile, the increasing negative reception of the carter administration was highlighted by the reagan campaign, including the recent iran hostage crisis and the poor economy. in response to carter saying that his 12-year-old daughter was concerned about nuclear warfare in the october presidential debate, he was lampooned by several political cartoons and late-night television jokes. among reagans more notable moments from the debate were his closing remarks. he asked the viewing public if they truly felt better off on a national, economic, and political level under the carter administration; and if they were not, then there was another choice that they had. the debate was seen as a win for reagan, as his campaign went from being behind carters by eight points to being ahead by three. central to reagans sudden surge in support after the debate was his frequent use of storytelling and carefully-timed witticisms, both of which helped to cement his public image as an appealing, likable figure. on election day, the reagan-bush ticket won 489 electoral votes against carter-mondales 49, rendering the former the winners of the 1980 presidential election. in addition, the republicans won majority control over both chambers of congress, shifting the legislative branch into republican control for the first time since eisenhowers election in 1952. at the time of his victory, ronald reagan was the oldest person to be made president at the age of 69. this record was later broken by donald trump at the age of 70 in 2016, and once again by joe biden at the age of 77 in 2020. for the republicans, the most popular of the prospective candidates was ronald reagan. after narrowly losing the nomination in the previous 1976 election, reagan managed to defeat several of his fellow republican candidates, including senate minority leader howard baker and senator robert dole. the strongest rival to reagan in the primaries was george herbert walker bush, a u.s. navy veteran, former congressman from texas, and the former director of central intelligence. despite the intense popularity of both candidates in their respective circles, reagan managed to win the nomination over bush at the republican national convention, after which the former chose the latter to serve as his running mate for the election. in the election cycle, reagan enjoyed support largely among evangelical christians, new deal-era democrats who had allied with the republicans after the 1960s, and the increasing electoral centers of the sun belt and the american suburbs. reagan made several public promises with the underlying goal of restoring american confidence and optimism, which had been severely tested and challenged by the troubles of the 1960s and 1970s. increasing defense spending was a high priority for reagans platform, as the american public had lost confidence in the u.s. militarys capabilities since both the vietnam war and carters ill-fated rescue mission in iran. to address the economic instabilities of the era, reagan proposed a balanced budget, the implementation of a supply-side economic policy (lower taxes, less regulations, free trade), and the withdrawal of carters previous windfall tax. if these policies were to be enacted, reagan promised that they would mark the beginning of the end of inflation. a central tenet to reagans campaign was his belief that the federal government had grown too far beyond the implied parameters of the constitution. he had held these beliefs since his earliest foray into politics in the 1960s, but the nationwide crises and incidents of corruption through the ensuing decades increased public belief in reagans views on smaller government. ronald reagan won the republican presidential nomination in 1980 and chose as his running mate former texas congressman and united nations ambassador george bush. voters troubled by inflation and by the year-long confinement of americans in iran swept the republican ticket into office. reagan won 489 electoral votes to 49 for president jimmy carter. ronald reagan, originally an american actor and politician, became the 40th president of the united states serving from 1981 to 1989. his term saw a restoration of prosperity at home, with the goal of achieving peace through strength abroad. the kgb chief also stated that during their meeting in moscow tunney said kennedy wanted to run for president in 1988, and that showing he still had political muscle after his failed 1980 presidential bid could only help his ambitions. ""kennedy does not discount that during the 1984 campaign, the democratic party may officially turn to him to lead the fight against the republicans and elect their candidate president,"" chebrikov wrote. ted kennedy, the u.s. senate's longtime ""liberal lion,"" apparently tried to take advantage of reagan's aggressive stance toward communist russia -- by seeking the russians' assistance. the federalist's sean davis writes that ""in the midst of the cold war, (kennedy) begged them to intervene in a u.s. presidential election in order to unseat president ronald reagan."" years later, it became clear how the presidential election that took place on nov. 4, 1980exactly 35 years agochanged americas history, ushering in a new era of conservatism and placing ronald reagan at its forefront. but up until the vote actually happened, few saw it coming. this article discusses the domestic policy of the ronald reagan administration from 1981 to 1989. reagan's policies stressed conservative economic values"

Conflicting,"If Florida expanded Medicaid, ""some studies indicate it would create about 120,000 jobs.""","sep 27, 2011  fox & friends pushed the claim that the jobs created by president obama's jobs bill would cost $200000 per job, with co-host brian kilmeade ... what would medicaid expansion mean for florida? a new report forecasts the five-year implications of medicaid expansion in florida on enrollment and budgets, starting in 2020. the report predicts that 837,514 floridians would be newly enrolled in medicaid within the first five years if the state adopted the expansion. in addition, $2.1 billion in new federal dollars would come into the state in 2020 and a total $14.3 billion in new federal dollars over five years. the net state budget cost of expansion would be $81 million in 2020, or a total of $516.4 million over five years. these costs would be more than offset by fiscal gains in other parts of the system. there also would likely be fiscal gains as expanded medicaid coverage offsets state-funded services in other programs. for example, some behavioral health services for the uninsured currently paid for by the state could be covered through expanded medicaid. this could free up $119.3 million in state funds in 2020. additional fiscal gains may occur in corrections, public health, and uncompensated care for uninsured florida residents. florida medicaid spending grew 13.5% on average every year between 1980 and 2004. in an effort to slow that trend, florida applied for and received approval for an 1115 waiver for its medicaid reform pilot. the pilot implemented managed care in two counties in 2006 and added three more counties in 2007; the waiver was extended several times. floridas decision not to expand medicaid leaves nearly 400,000 people in the state in the coverage gap  ineligible for medicaid and also ineligible for tax subsidies to help them afford private health insurance (people with income over 100% of the poverty level are currently eligible for premium subsidies in the exchange, but those with income between 100% and 138% of the poverty level would switch to medicaid eligibility if florida were to expand coverage). is medicaid enrollment growing in florida? although florida has not expanded medicaid under the aca, enrollment in the states program continued to grow over the years. but it is starting to decline in 2023, due to the end of the pandemic-era pause on disenrollments. enrollment stood at 2.2 million in 2005, and had grown to 3.7 million by the end of 2013. by april 2023, total florida medicaid and chip enrollment stood at nearly 5.8 million people, but it dropped to 5.5 million in may 2023, the first month that post-pandemic disenrollments took effect. 24 mar 2017  but they will be temporary. keystone pipeline would create about 3,900 construction jobs if it was built in one year, according to a state ... the commonwealth fund, a new york-based organization that focuses on health care issues, released the report, which said expanding medicaid in florida would add 61,600 health-care jobs from 2022 to 2025. it also said an expansion would lead to job increases in the construction, retail, finance and insurance sectors. florida could add 134,700 jobs, lower the number of uninsured residents by 852,000 and pump billions of additional federal dollars into the economy if it would expand medicaid to low-income adults without children, according to a report released thursday. according to the commonwealth fund analysis, floridas costs for expanding medicaid to childless adults would increase by $681 million in 2022. but that would be more than offset by a net gain of $6.6 billion in federal funding for the year."

Conflicting,"Says Secretary of State Rex Tillerson got a ""government service golden parachute"" payment of $180 million ""from Exxon Mobil that he would have to forfeit had he taken a job elsewhere.""","ousted secretary of state rex tillerson may have gotten more than he bargained for in his 14 months trying to keep up with a president full of surprises in donald trump. but the former exxon mobil ceo leaves the top diplomatic post with his beneficial tax deals on stock holdings that amounted to more than $200 million. tillerson, like other trump officials with large financial holdings, was required to avoid conflicts of interest in stocks when assuming office because of federal law. there's nothing untoward about it  the law is designed to allow private citizens to assume important public roles without conflicts of interest related to their personal wealth. it gives cabinet members the option of selling stocks on a tax-deferred basis as the cleanest way to remove conflicts, and then they can invest those proceeds in diversified holdings such as mutual funds or treasury bonds. in the case of tillerson, a large piece of his stock holdings were a little different than the norm. typically, private citizens who sell stocks to serve in federal office defer any capital gains until such time as whatever replacement investments they bought are sold and subject to taxes. the former oil ceo had a huge stake in exxon mobil stock available to him as an executive compensation reward that accrued over four decades with exxon mobil but had not yet been granted and would normally be paid out in retirement over a decade. the new york times estimated in january 2017 that tillerson's exxon stake of roughly 2 million shares was worth $174 million. but tillerson could not be paid in stock and without potentially running afoul of government ethics laws. the oil giant agreed to sell the stock and set up a cash trust for tillerson that would be invested in securities such as treasury bonds, and pay tillerson regularly over a decade. tillerson would only forfeit the right to payments from the trust if he took a job with a competing oil company. bloomberg estimated last year that the plan would save tillerson from an immediate federal income tax bill of as much as $72 million. tillerson also had an estimated $54 million in directly owned exxon mobil shares he had to sell. the state department's legal team also outlined tillerson's plans to divest exxon shares in an ethic letters sent to the government in early january 2017. all of tillerson's public company holdings were outlined in a financial disclosure report he filed last march with the government and include stock holdings he would have had to divest separate from the exxon retirement plan. state department and exxon mobil did not immediately return requests for comment. robert willens, a new york-based tax and account expert, said all of these stock sales to meet government ethics requirements are designed to not require reporting of income and defer taxes. the tax ""home run"" willens said, is if tillerson holds the investment accounts that replaced the stock holdings until death, at which time the value would pass to his heirs on a ""stepped up"" basis. that means they would not be required to report a gain or loss based on the value at the time tillerson sold. for example, instead of a stock sold at $1,000 and that had gained in value to $10,000  a $9,000 tax basis  the heirs' value is based on the day that it is transferred, at $10,000, so there is no gain to report. in that case, the tax deferral is likely to become a situation in which the holdings are never subject to income tax, willens said. find answers to frequently asked elections questions to the secretary of state's office here. browning, in his official capacity as secretary of state for the. state of florida (the ""secretary""), files this response to plaintiffs' supplemental.50 pages 8 feb 2023  we had a 5% gdp [gross domestic product] deficit when he took office. but clinton had the courage to raise taxes and to cut military spending. the u.s. state department unveiled the official portrait of the 67th secretary of state, hillary clinton on tuesday. by news desk. politics jun 13."

(recent changes in marijuana laws in alaska, oregon, and washington, dc are not reflected in the 2014 arrest data, but will be reflected in 2015 data.) according to the 2014 uniform crime report, police made 700,993 arrests for marijuana-related offenses, some 7,500 more arrests than were reported in 2013. of those arrested, 619,808 (over 88 percent) were charged with possession only  a two percent increase since 2013. how many crimes the 272,111 prison- ers ever committed  both prior arrest for violence, and 21.6% were arrested for a violent crime after their release."

developments as ""historic"" and said that it will go a long way in strengthening strategic-ties between india and france . this is a new milestone in bilateral ties, said rajnath singh.india had signed an agreement with france for the procurement of 36 rafale fighter jets at a cost of rs. 59,000 crore in september 2016. the first batch of four jets will come next may.commenting on the positives of this- receiving rafale from france, singh said it will enhance the capabilities of the indian air force and lay a global blueprint for successful defence cooperation between two responsible states. he also thanked the french state for providing support and training to indian air force pilots.the fighters  to be armed with the scalp ground attack missiles that have a range well over 300 km  will be flown by iaf pilots in france for at least 1,500 hours as part of the testing and acceptance process before they come to their home base in ambala. the first batch of four combat jets is expected to be ferried to india by may.while the formal handover ceremony takes place this week, the first batch of four rafale jets will fly to their home base in india by may 2020. all 36 jets are expected to arrive in india by september 2022, for which the iaf has been reportedly undertaking preparations, including readying required infrastructure and training of pilots.on

singh's cue and use tempered language. nda's ally and janata dal (united) supremo nitish kumar on tuesday broke off ties with the bharatiya janata party once again to form an alliance with his political opponent lalu prasad yadav's rashtriya janata dal, paving the way for a 'mahagathbandhan 2.0' ahead of the 2024 lok sabha elections.however, political analysts say there is a major difference between nitish's exit from the nda during 2013 and now in 2022.the jd(u) supremo breaking alliance with the bjp in 2013 and now in 2022 is enough to tell what and how much the former still holds relevance as a leader in the politics of bihar?in 2013, nitish kumar had left the bjp following his protests against the then gujarat chief minister narendra modi but at that time instead of resigning from the chief minister's post, he had dismissed the then deputy chief minister sushil kumar modi, including all the ministers from the bjp quota, from his government. at that time the bjp had said that the jd(u) leader left the nda alliance in a haste.but in 2022, nitish kumar's exit from the nda is extremely clear. what political decision would he take was predicted in the political circles for a long time?bjp leaders were fully aware this time that the jd(u) supremo was going to leave the nda alliance in bihar but it was quite surprising that the saffron party did not make any effort to persuade him from leaving the nda alliance.on monday, sources from the jd(u) planted news reports that a senior bjp leader had spoken to nitish kumar before him breaking away from the nda alliance. however, these reports were immediately denied by the bjp.this time the bjp did not try to persuade the bihar chief minister for several reasons since the former felt that the latter had already made up his mind to expand his political ambitions in national politics and for this he had to seek help and join hands with lalu prasad yadav in bihar and the congress in new delhi.according to the bjp, the popularity of nitish kumar has reduced considerably in bihar during the last few years.a top bihar bjp leader says that the results of the 2020 bihar assembly elections have proved that nitish kumar's sway on the people of the state has reduced and the people is now looking at the bjp as an alternative party to jd(u).a bjp leader went a step further while criticising the bihar chief minister, saying that the latter was harming the interests of bihar due to his political ambitions, selfishness and stubbornness.considering the future political prospects and nitish's stubborness, the bjp leaders did not make any effort to persuade nitish kumar to remain in the nda alliance and save the coalition government in bihar.however, it is evident from the political statements made by union ministers giriraj singh and ashwini choubey and bihar bjp president sanjay jaiswal, including other party leaders that the bjp is going to campaign in bihar on a mass level and will come up with a strategy to take revenge from nitish kumar."

Conflicting,"""Harvard report says 4645 people died in Puerto Rico as a result of Hurricane Maria.""","census bureau table data search results for text query all states within united states, puerto rico, and the island areas iowa. how did hurricane maria affect puerto rico? more disasters have hit puerto rico since hurricane maria, prolonging the islands recovery. on january 7, 2020, a 6.4 magnitude earthquake struck puerto rico. one person was killed, hundreds were left seeking temporary shelter and some 250,000 people lacked access to clean water. puerto ricos governor declared a state of emergency and activated puerto ricos national guard. additionally, predictions from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration, 2020 will have an above-normal atlantic hurricane season  a season that has already affected communities across puerto rico. on july 30, 2020, tropical storm isaias knocked out power and caused flooding on the island. heavy rains in communities, already weakened by the earthquake and subsequent aftershock, caused homes to collapse. the storm also left some 150,000 without water and cut power to more than 400,000 homes, businesses and hospitals. everyone is in a constant state of emergency, said marieli grant, a mercy corps team member based in san juan. the pandemic is yet another crisis for puerto rico. the centers for disease control and prevention has warned that the risk for transmission of covid-19 is high and is advising against any non-essential travel to the island. the threat of infection is slowing the recovery of tourism-based companies and creating new challenges for future disasters. a recent spike in confirmed cases caused many puerto ricans to be wary of seeking shelter during tropical storm isaias. the effects of the storm have undoubtedly been felt most by the people themselves. the storm left thousands of families without homes and destroyed some communities entirely. in august 2018, the puerto rican government raised the official death toll to an estimated 2,975 people  46 times higher than the original count of 64 deaths, released in december 2017. for months after the initial disaster, most families and businesses remained without power, cell phone service was limited, and clean water, food, medicine and fuel were all in very short supply. according to the new england journal of medicine, households went 84 days without power, 68 days without water, and 41 days without cell service, on average. to produce an independent estimate of lives lost as a result of the storm, the researchers surveyed 3,299 randomly chosen households across puerto rico. participants were asked about infrastructure damage, displacement, and deaths. results from the survey showed that there were an estimated 14.3 deaths per 1,000 people between september 20 and december 31, 2017. by comparing this post-hurricane mortality rate with the same time period in 2016, the researchers estimated that there were 4,645 [95% ci, 793 to 8498] additional deaths in the three-month period following hurricane maria. boston, ma  the mortality rate in puerto rico rose by 62% [95% confidence interval (ci) 11% to 114%] after hurricane maria, according to a new study led by researchers from harvard t.h. chan school of public health. the study was conducted in january and february 2018, in collaboration with colleagues from carlos albizu university in puerto rico and the university of colorado school of medicine. as with any major natural disaster, assessing the loss of life caused by hurricane maria was difficult and contentious. for disaster-related deaths to be confirmed in puerto rico, bodies must be transported to san juan or a medical examiner must travel to the region to verify the death. this makes it difficult to log deaths that were caused by delays in treatment or chronic conditions that worsened in the aftermath of the storm. in december 2017, media reports suggested that the official death toll was significantly underestimated. puerto rico defaulted in 2015 when it paid only $628,000 toward a $58 million bond payment. damage from hurricane maria in 2017 then exacerbated the island's economic and debt crisis. puerto rico announced plans to cut its debt to roughly $86 billion from $129 billion in 2019 in the largest bankruptcy in u.s. history. the bankruptcy filing was authorized under a 2016 law passed by congress. the puerto rico oversight, management, and economic stability act (promesa) also established a financial board to oversee the territory's public finances. puerto ricos death toll in the aftermath of hurricane maria is estimated to be almost 5,000, according to a harvard study published tuesday. data from this large-scale survey also revealed some sobering information about what life has been like for those trying to manage their health on the island in the wake of the storm. the study, which surveyed 3,299 randomly chosen households in puerto rico over three weeks, found that from sept. 20 to dec. 31, 2017, at least 4,645 people died in connection to the storm. the governments death toll is 64. researchers calculated this new alarmingly high death toll and gathered facts about causes of death, displacement and infrastructure loss in the months after the storm. the information paints a distressing picture of the sort of challenges that millions of puerto ricans faced after hurricane irma and hurricane maria ravaged the island in september of last year."

True,"In Iowa, “since we have put a number of the voting laws into place over the last several years — voter ID is one of those — we've actually seen voter participation increase, even in off-election years.”","theres a large body of research that has found that strict voter id laws disproportionately impact voters of color. in 2017, legislatures in arkansas and in north dakota passed voter id bills, which governors in each state signed, and missouri implemented a restrictive law that was passed by ballot initiative in 2016. (texas also passed a new voter id law, though its earlier strict voter id law was partially in effect in 2016.) georgia, iowa, indiana, and new hampshire also enacted restrictions last year, in addition to laws that were on the books for previous elections. overall, 25 states have put in place new restrictions since then  15 states have more restrictive voter id laws in place (including six states with strict photo id requirements), 12 have laws making it harder for citizens to register (and stay registered), ten made it more difficult to vote early or absentee, and three took action to make it harder to restore voting rights for people with past criminal convictions. 2021-08-17  suppression efforts range from the seemingly unobstructive, like strict voter id laws and cuts to early voting, to mass purges of voter rolls ... since the 2008 elections, over 95% of returned mail ballots were counted. the percentage of rejected mail ballots varies depending on the election year. in 2008, 4.5% of returned mail ballots were rejected which is the highest in the last decade. the rejection percentage has remained consistently below 1.5% since the 2010 election. in midterm years it has ranged between 1.3% (2010) and 1.4% (2014, 2018). it has consistently been 0.9% in the remaining presidential years (2012 and 2016). it is expected that the rejected ballot percentage will increase in 2020 as more voters are expected to vote by mail, some for the first time. with this in mind, the percentage of returned by-mail ballots remained largely constant during presidential election years, hovering between 80% and 83%. thus, comparing 2008 and 2016, the presidential elections at each end of the data analyzed, the rate of return decreased by less than 1%. between the midterm years of 2010 and 2018, the rate of return decreased by 6.2%. since the 2010 elections, over a majority of states and territories reported that less than 10% of voters casted their ballots by mail. the 2008 election was the only year where less than a majority (49%) of states reported fewer than 10% of mail voters. during the 2018 election, 31 states and territories (57.4%) reported less than a tenth of voters who participated by mail, which is the highest percentage of states in the last decade. it is expected that more voters will vote by mail in 2020, than ever before, if so then we should expect substantial increases in the states with a low percentage of mail voters. 5 oct. 2022  north carolina voter id law comparison. north carolina's general assembly enacted s.b. 824, a common sense photo id requirement for ..."

False,Wearing two Pnp face masks offers stronger protection than wearing one N95 mask.,"when you have symptoms of cold, flu, covid-19, wearing a surgical face mask can protect others from getting sick. it is important that you use caution when in other words, wearing a high-quality mask offers substantial protection even if others arent wearing onebut two-way masking is even better, the study suggests. respirators like n95s are the most protective masks on the market, but they only work to their fullest extent when they fit properly. your respirator should create a tight seal on your face, without gaps that let in air. (experts say that a good way to test this is to cup your hands near your face and breathe in and out. if your mask fits well, you shouldnt feel any air escaping.) if one person is unmasked and freely exhaling germs, the burden of protection is all on the other persons mask. while cloth and surgical masks provide some defense in this scenario, respirators such as n95s and kn95s are designed to filter out almost all particles, making them the best and most protective options for one-way masking. de y wang  2021  cit 83 fois  for example, hong kong recommended mask wearing for all in order to prevent respiratory viruses, while germany claimed no evidences that the masks could ... by tk chan  2020  cited by 34  limited duration of mask wearing may underestimate effect. students were encouraged but not obligated to wear their face masks outside of their residence hall. when is it a good idea to wear two masks? zabaneh said that one case in which its a good idea to wear double masks is when there are concerns about source control. for source control purposes, anyone who is wearing a mask with an exhalation valve (including n95 respirators with exhalation valves) should apply a secondary mask on top of the primary one, he said. this is intended to provide protection for others if the wearer of the mask with the exhalation valve is infected with sars-cov-2. in addition, the cdc is now recommending double masking as a way to improve mask fit and reduce the spread of covid-19. according to the cdc report, wearing a cloth mask over a medical mask can provide substantially improved source control as well as reducing exposure of the wearer. in theory, double masking helps control the spread of covid-19 according to firas zabaneh, mt (ascp), cic, cie, director of system infection prevention and control for houston methodist hospital in houston, texas, double masking might help. zabaneh said the rationalization for wearing two masks is that youre adding more layers of filtration. filtration efficiency is increased, zabaneh said, so fewer particles penetrate through the masks. however, he cautions that wearing two masks may give people a false sense of security. if a person is wearing two low quality masks on top of each other, it may not be very effective. in addition, if not done properly, wearing two masks could actually increase a persons risk by allowing leakage around the edges. double masking is most helpful when there are concerns about source control. on a recent appearance on the today show, dr. anthony fauci, who is the chief medical adviser on covid-19 for the president, said that double masking is a move that just makes common sense and is likely to provide more protection against the transmission of covid-19. in addition, high profile figures like transportation secretary pete buttigieg and his husband, chasten, have been spotted wearing double masks in recent weeks. is double masking a good idea for you? when and how should you go about doing it? heres what we currently know."

True,"""A white family is likely to have about six times as much wealth than a black or Hispanic family coming out of the recession.""","black, hispanic and white families had more wealth at the average$143,000, $249,000 and $962,000, respectivelythan at the median. these findings are a function of the wealth distribution within each racial and ethnic group: there are few very wealthy families, but their vast amount of wealth pulls the average up. for example, the figure below shows wealth at the 75th percentile, which is lower than the average, meaning most black, hispanic and white families have less than the groups average. because of this, we choose to compare medians (values at the middle of the distribution), as we believe these are more representative of a typical familys experience. notes: this graphic shows the relative size of family wealth for different racial and ethnic groups. from left to right, the 25th percentiles, 50th percentiles or medians, and 75th percentiles are shown. also, wealth gaps in terms of black and hispanic families cents per every dollar of white family wealth are shown for each percentile group. across generations, black and hispanic families consistently had less median wealth than white families. for example, white baby boomers (born between 1946 and 1964) owned $331,000 at the median, considerably more than hispanic boomers, with $141,000, and black boomers, with $45,000 at the median. black millennials (born between 1981 and 1996) had very low levels of accumulated wealth, owning just $3,000 at the median. hispanic millennials fared better, with $15,000, though not as well as white millennials, who had median wealth of $53,000. in percentage terms, the median wealth of black and hispanic families increased more over the period than did the median wealth of white while there have always been substantial differences in the wealth accumulated by the white, black, and hispanic families living in the united states, these differences had remained relatively constant over most of the last three decades before rising sharply during the great recession. the greater losses in net worth that nonwhite families experienced between 2007 and 2010 has inspired renewed interest in understanding the factors that drive these enduring racial wealth disparities. this paper uses data from the federal reserve boards survey of consumer finances (scf) to update and extend the existing literature, and explores the key factors contributing to the wealth gap that persists among white, black, and hispanic families. 11 mai 2022  disney plus has 69% white viewers, 17% hispanic, 10% black, and 2% asian or other ethnicities. 14. the disney plus target market is families, ... overall, american household wealth has not fully recovered from the great recession. in 2016, the median wealth of all u.s. households was $97,300, up 16% from 2013 but well below median wealth before the recession began in late 2007 ($139,700 in 2016 dollars). and even though overall racial and ethnic inequality in wealth narrowed from 2013 to 2016, the gap remains large. in 2016, the median wealth of white households was $171,000. thats 10 times the wealth of black households ($17,100)  a larger gap than in 2007  and eight times that of hispanic households ($20,600), about the same gap as in 2007. (asians and other racial groups are not separately identified in the scf data.) there is also a growing separation in wealth among white households by income tier. in 2016, upper-income white families had six times as much wealth as middle-income white families, compared with four times as much prior to the recession. upper-income white families also had 42 times the wealth of lower-income white families in 2016, compared with 18 times the wealth in 2007. these large wealth gaps were trimmed roughly in half by the great recession, which cut the median wealth of lower-income white households to $21,900 in 2010, a loss of 49%. losses for lower-income black and hispanic households were much smaller, 3% and 5%, respectively. the larger losses for lower-income white families may have arisen from their greater exposure to the housing market crash. in 2007, 56% of lower-income whites were homeowners, compared with 32% each of lower-income blacks and hispanics. the homeownership rate among lower-income whites has trended downward since then, falling to 49% by 2016, but the rate for blacks and hispanics is largely unchanged."

False,“The proposed tax increases in the Biden administration’s infrastructure plan could lead to 1 million fewer jobs in the first two years.”,"as part of his fiscal year 2016 budget, the president proposed a net tax increase of $1.55 trillion with the additional revenue used for infrastructure spending and the growth in other government spending programs. in total, the plan includes $2.4 trillion in proposed tax increases offset by $713 billion in new credits, deductions, and other offsets, for a total tax increase of nearly $1.7 trillion over the next ten years. the presidents budget includes a new minimum tax on foreign-earned income, changes to the foreign tax credits, and elimination or repeal of a number of provisions used to account for real business costs for tax increase of $550 billion. overall, bidens tax plan would make the tax code more progressive, with the vast majority of increased tax burdens and the entirety of direct tax increases falling on high-income households. according to the four outside estimators, bidens tax plan would increase taxes for the top one-fifth of earners by 2.3 to 5.7 percent of after-tax income in 2021. this increase is driven by a 13.0 to 17.8 percent increase for the top 1 percent. with these adjustments, we find that bidens tax plan would increase net revenue by between $3.35 trillion and $3.67 trillion, or 1.3 to 1.4 percent of gdp. this is the equivalent of increasing revenue by almost one-tenth relative to current law. major proposals by the biden campaign would raise $1.6 to $1.9 trillion over a decade from corporations, $1.0 to $1.2 trillion from high earners through the income tax, and $800 billion to $1 trillion from social security payroll taxes on high-wage earners. biden also supports a fee on banks, which we believe will raise $100 billion, tax credits for renters and first-time homebuyers that we estimate will cost $300 billion, and an increase of the child and dependent care tax credit, which we estimate will cost $100 billion. some commentators suggest that a more likely scenario is that any increase in the capital gain tax rate will become effective on the date the bill is introduced or passed. this timing suggests there may be a window to recognize embedded gains at current rates before a potential increase in rates. in the american families plan (afp), the biden administration is proposing an increased tax rate on capital gains and qualified dividends to equal the top ordinary income tax rate of 39.6% for households earning over $1 million (or $500,000 if married filing separately). currently, the top ordinary rate for individuals is 37%, but the afp also proposes a return to 39.6% for the top marginal tax rate for individuals. it should also be noted that the net investment income tax of 3.8% would be imposed in addition to the income tax, resulting in a tax rate of 43.4% on capital gains for high earners. according to the biden administration, the overall goal of these changes in capital gains taxation is to equalize capital gain and ordinary income tax rates for high earners, thereby eliminating tax benefits that have historically and disproportionately favored high net worth individuals. the plan is a big increase from trump's proposal for vehicle fuel efficiency by 2026 of just 43.3 mpg. the biden administration said epa rules would require higher efficiency by 2026 than former president barack obama's administration would have mandated through 2025. will the biden tax plan increase my taxes? on march 31, 2021, biden proposed the american jobs plan, which would increase income taxes on corporate profits. the increased taxes were to help fund the plans infrastructure improvement goals, estimated to cost $2.3 trillion. the details of the corporate tax changes are discussed below and include a higher corporate tax, as well as new minimum taxes on book income and profits of multinational corporations. the biden administrations tax proposals would raise the corporate tax rate, impose new minimum taxes to prevent profitable u.s. businesses from escaping taxes through aggressive tax planning, repeal incentives for offshoring jobs, end preferences for the fossil-fuel industry, and strengthen corporate tax law enforcement by the irs."

False,"“In 1950, there were around 10,000 polar bears globally. Today, polar bear populations are near 39,000. Polar bear populations are increasing dramatically as the planet has warmed.”","however, the trend in populations for which there is data points to a species in decline, compared to two or three decades ago. and with the impacts of warming on polar bear habitat and feeding well-understood, scientists are clear that polar bears face a profound threat to their survival in the coming decades. the iucn assessment does not look at the extinction risk for polar bears over a time span of longer than about 35 years  or three generations of polar bears. but without action to tackle climate change, it is likely that many polar bear subpopulations will cross tipping points over the next century if sea-ice loss continues as forecasted, says cator. meanwhile, ice fragmentation is reducing many polar bears range of travel and causing polar bear subpopulations to become increasingly isolated. warming has also been linked to increases in contamination and exposure to diseases. polar bears in many ways have become the symbol of climate change. in 2008, they were listed as a threatened species under the endangered species act -- the first species to be listed because of forecasted population declines from the effects of climate change. the primary cause of their decline: loss of sea ice habitat attributed to arctic warming. polar bears need sea ice to hunt seals -- a main source of food -- as well as to move across the large home ranges they need for foraging habitat. polar bears arent alone in feeling the effects of shrinking sea ice. walruses and other arctic species are facing similar challenges as summer sea ice continues to retreat. photo by national park service. polar bears rely heavily on sea ice for traveling, hunting, resting, mating and, in some areas, maternal dens. but because of ongoing and potential loss of their sea ice habitat resulting from climate changethe primary threat to polar bears arctic-widepolar bears were listed as a threatened species in the us under the endangered species act in may 2008. as their sea ice habitat recedes earlier in the spring and forms later in the fall, polar bears are increasingly spending longer periods on land, where they are often attracted to areas where humans live. the survival and the protection of the polar bear habitat are urgent issues for wwf. in october 2019, the international union for the conservation of nature (iucn) polar bear specialist group released a new assessment of polar bear populations showing that the number of polar bear subpopulations experience recent declines has increased to four, with eight populations still being data-deficient. the good news is that five populations are stable while two have been experiencing an upward trend. in summary, commercial whalers and fur traders slaughtered a huge number of polar bears world-wide, especially between 1890 to 1930, when more than 60,000 bears were harvested over a 40 year period. polar bears share this history with many other marine mammals  they are not unique in that respect. however, in contrast to those other species, the modern literature on polar bears is largely silent about that black period of its history (except for stirling 2011), to the detriment of modern polar bear research. this means that before the intense sport hunting of polar bears (from about 1930 through late 1960s) had even begun, at least 6x as many bears per year had already been removed as are now taken from these regions. this subset of modern harvests come from a global population estimated at 20,000-25,000 bears (obbard et al. 2010)]. that does not mean the pre-harvest population was 6 times as large as it is now, but it is an indication that many more bears must have existed in the 1800s than exist now. my calculations, based on the honderich and uspenski figures, suggest that more than 60,000 polar bears were harvested in the 40 years between 1890 and 1930 from three areas alone: all of hudson bay, davis strait and svalbard combined (assuming about 30,000 taken by whalers plus 1,500 by fur traders in canada plus about 30,000 taken in svalbard). as honderich suggests, the actual numbers are probably higher rather than lower (for canada at least, probably for svalbard as well). at-risk polar bears are often a sign of something wrong with the arctic marine ecosystem. the key danger for polar bears posed by the effects of climate change"

False,"""I had prostate cancer, five, six years ago. My chance of surviving prostate cancer, and thank God I was cured of it, in the United States, 82%. My chances of surviving prostate cancer in England, only 44% under socialized medicine.""","sexual activity has been associated with risk factors for prostate cancer in a number of studies, but the mechanisms involved are unknown. some research has suggested that men with a high sex drive have increased levels of male hormones, such as androgens, which has been linked to an increased risk of prostate cancer. dimitropoulou et al. carried out a casecontrol study to examine the association between frequency of sexual activity and prostate cancer risk. the researchers obtained information on intercourse and masturbation and assessed these factors individually and in combination (overall sexual activity), in 431 men diagnosed with prostate cancer before the age of 60 years, and in 409 men selected as controls. information on lifestyle and sexual activity throughout adult life was collected by means of a postal questionnaire. data collected included age at which the men first became sexually active, number of sexual partners, any sexually transmitted infections, and how often the men masturbated and had intercourse in their 20s, 30s, 40s and 50s. a new study has found a positive correlation between increased sexual activity in men in their 20s and 30s and risk of prostate cancer. dimitropoulou and colleagues, who investigated both intercourse and masturbation, also found that sexual activity seemed to protect against prostate cancer in men in their 50s. prostate cancer is more common in some areas. rates are higher in north america, europe, and australia than in areas such as asia, africa, and central and south america. experts do not know why, but lifestyle factors such as diet may play a role. family history: males have a higher risk of prostate cancer if they have close relatives, such as a father or brother, with a history of the condition. as men get older, their risk of developing prostate cancer increases. around 60% of prostate cancer cases affect males over 65. race: african american males are more likely to develop prostate cancer than white males. hispanic and asian american males are less likely to develop prostate cancer than non-hispanic white males. the reasons for these differences are currently unclear. is there a link? over the past almost 20 years, a number of articles have claimed that ejaculating more often can reduce the risk of prostate cancer. some scientific evidence supports these claims, although results can be conflicting. a 2004 study surveyed more than 29,000 men on their ejaculation frequency over a period of eight years. it found that men with a higher ejaculation frequency (21 times or more per month) may have a lower risk of developing prostate cancer than men who ejaculate four to seven times per month. a 2016 study added a further 10 years of follow-up to the original 2004 study. the results reinforced the finding that men who ejaculate more frequently may be less likely to develop prostate cancer than those who ejaculate less often. other studies have produced conflicting results: frequent ejaculation, age, and prostate cancer risk it still remains unclear whether or not ejaculating more often makes males of all ages less likely to develop prostate cancer. for example, an older 2003 study found that men who frequently ejaculated when they were younger appeared to have a reduced rate of prostate cancer later in life. in contrast, a 2009 study found that frequent masturbation might reduce the risk of prostate cancer in men aged 50 and above. however, the same study also suggested that ejaculating more often might increase risk among men in their 20s and 30s. a more recent 2017 study examined ejaculation frequency and the risk of aggressive prostate cancer. it found that a higher ejaculation frequency in a males 30s was protective. however, it did not see the same effect for frequent ejaculation in a males 20s and 40s. moderate vs. frequent ejaculation the 2004 and 2016 studies defined frequent ejaculation as ejaculating 21 or more times per month. however, it may also be possible for males who ejaculate at a more moderate frequency to reduce their prostate cancer risk. a 2018 meta-analysis included 22 studies on sexual activity and prostate cancer risk. it found that a moderate ejaculation frequency of two to four times per week was significantly associated with a lower prostate cancer risk. this equates to a frequency of about 816 ejaculations per month. the verdict: more research is needed a 2016 literature review concluded that masturbation, frequency of ejaculation, and age all affect a males risk of prostate cancer. however, its authors also stated there was not enough evidence to confirm how these factors might link together. therefore, while some evidence suggests a link between ejaculating more often and the risk of prostate cancer, the results overall have been inconsistent. for this reason, scientists need to conduct more research to confirm what impact, if any, frequent ejaculation has on prostate cancer risk. 5 juil. 2017  ejaculating at least 21 times a month significantly reduces a man's risk of prostate cancer  this is compared to men who ejaculate just four-to- ... 27 apr 2021  there is currently no scientific evidence to support the use of onion juice as a remedy for prostate problems, including prostate cancer. while ... 1 research suggests that drinking enough water every day, could reduce your risk of developing cancer of the large bowel, breast and prostate. cancer of the ..."

Conflicting,"""President Obama pledged to go through the budget 'line by line,' but on his watch, non-defense spending has spiraled out of control, increasing by 67 percent in the last year alone.""","how is the defense budget allocated? the national defense budget funds a wide range of activities and represents a significant share of overall federal spending. indeed, the united states spends more than any other advanced economy in this area, not only in raw dollars, but also as a share of the economy. while the appropriate level of defense funding is part of an ongoing debate, one thing is clear  national defense spending is currently one of the top priorities of the u.s. federal government. the united states spent $766 billion on national defense during fiscal year (fy) 2022 according to the office of management and budget, which amounted to 12 percent of federal spending. defense spending in 2022 was less than the average for the last decade, which was 15 percent of the budget. such spending indicates that lawmakers have prioritized national defense as a key part of our budget; indeed, the united states spends more on defense, relative to the size of its economy, than any other member of the g7 (a group of the worlds largest advanced economies, the members of which are shown in the chart below). this explainer looks at the components of the u.s. defense budget. how has discretionary spending changed over time? in 1973, discretionary spending amounted to 9.6 percent of gdp, with about 60 percent of that for defense. today, discretionary spending is 6.6 percent of gdp. a little under half of that goes to defense. defense spending, of course, rises with wars and with concerns about national security. defense spending was 9.2 percent of gdp in 1968 near the height of the vietnam war, reached a low of 2.9 percent in 1999 after the end of the cold war, and climbed to 4.6 percent of gdp by 2010, during the wars in iraq and afghanistan. defense spending has generally declined as a share of gdp since then, reaching 3 percent in 2022. in contrast to the significant declines in defense spending since the 1960s, non-defense discretionary spending has hovered between 3 and 4 percent of gdp in most years, with a few exceptions. it was, for instance, a bit above 4 percent of gdp during the great recession and the pandemic. non-defense spending in 2022 was 3.6 percent of gdp, a bit below its average level since 1962. what goes into the discretionary spending bucket? much of discretionary spendingabout 45 percent in recent yearsgoes to salaries and benefits for government employees, both military and civilian. about 15 percent goes to grants to state and local governments. most of the remainder goes to purchases of goods and services from the private sector. spending can also be decomposed by function. in 2022, about $750 billion, or 45 percent, of discretionary outlays went to defense, and $910 billion, or 55 percent, went to non-defensea broad category that includes certain health spending, (including veterans health, the national institutes of health, and public health), education and training (including pell grants for low-income college students and grants for k-12 schools with large numbers of low-income students), and transportation (including highways, bridges, and airports). most of the spending in the infrastructure and jobs act of 2021 (sometimes called the bipartisan infrastructure law) and the chips and science act of 2022 is discretionary spending. oct 12, 2012  president obama says that mitt romney wants to increase defense spending by $2 trillion over the next ten years, something that romney ... compared to other military conflicts, wwii saw the highest u.s. defense spending as a percentage of gdp of a secular increase in defense oct 2, 2017  president barack obama's tax, spending and deficit legacy has long been subject to intense debate. ... deficit reduction. they point to the ..."
